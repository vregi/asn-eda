## Explanatory Data Analysis of Aviation Accidents from Aviation Safety Network

### Objective
This project aims to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of aviation accident records from the Aviation Safety Network (ASN) to uncover trends, patterns, and potential contributing factors to aviation incidents between years of 1995 and 2024.
The analysis was intended to highlight how publicly available aviation data can be examined to reveal high-level patterns and risk areas. 
While the insights are not intended to support any conclusions, they offer a preliminary view into aviation safety dynamics based on historical occurrences.

Whole analysis and my work were described in the final [report](https://github.com/vregi/asn-eda/blob/main/report.ipynb).
