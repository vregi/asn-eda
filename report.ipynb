    "To investigate whether aviation accidents tend to happen more during certain parts of the year, we assigned each accident to a season based on its date, while accounting for hemisphere differences (so, for example, July in Brazil counts as Winter).\n",

    "The bar chart (see Figure 5.2.6) shows the overall distribution of accidents by season:\n",

    "- All seasons show a slight decline or stabilization in the number of accidents over the years, especially after 2000.\n",
    "- Summer accidents remain consistently high over time and even show noticeable peaks around the late 2010s and early 2020s.\n",

    "- Fall shows more fluctuations, with some years having sudden drops or spikes, possibly tied to isolated major events or smaller flight volumes in that season.\n",

    "We also wanted to examine whether aircraft age has any visible relationship with the severity of accidents, measured by the number of fatalities. To explore this, we grouped aircraft into age ranges (e.g., 0-10 years, 10-20 years, etc.) and plotted the number of fatalities for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in Figure 5.3.4, several clear patterns emerged:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accidents with the highest number of fatalities occurred mostly in younger to mid-age aircraft, particularly in the 0-20 year range.\n",
    "- While older aircraft (above 40-50 years) were still involved in accidents, they were less often associated with high fatality counts.\n",
    "- All age groups had many accidents with zero or very few fatalities, indicating that not all accidents are severe, regardless of aircraft age.\n",
    "- There are many outliers-some accidents had over 200 or even 300 fatalities-mostly concentrated in the newer age groups, which are also more likely to include large commercial aircraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "One explanation is that larger aircraft used for commercial passenger flights are often newer or mid-aged and tend to carry more people, so when a disaster happens, the fatality count is high. On the other hand, older aircraft are more often used in general aviation (e.g., private, cargo, or training), where fewer people are onboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, while aircraft age alone is not a direct indicator of risk, it seems to be related to the context of the flight-how the plane is used, and how many people it typically carries. Maintenance, regulations, and usage type may all be more important than age by itself.\n",
